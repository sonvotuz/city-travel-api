## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nodejs with Express

I built this project to practice Nodejs and used this fantastic tech to build an API, and client-side website to fetch the data from API and show the data. This API project is showing places in Vietnam which is my country, cause I love traveling and my country it is a spectacular place to visit and relax, I wish I could travel to all places in the project.

People can either type the places in English or in Vietnamese, the fetched data is still correct. There is a removeVietnameseCharacter function to handle that.

With the help of HTML5 Up design, I can make the website more eye-catchy.

## Optimizations

I would have collected more data for the API so users can get more information about the places like how to get there, things to do in that place, great friendly hostel, and local food rather than only displaying the place's image and a short description about the place. Would seriously think about optimizing the API data before launching the second version of this, which will contain tons of useful information and feature that help traveller.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that when I am collecting data for places, it is a really time-consuming task and I should definitely try to figure out a way to speed up the process.
